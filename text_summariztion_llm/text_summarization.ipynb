We apply a state-of-the art sentiment classification technique in order to investigate the question of whether \\nsentiment and attention measures contain additional predictive power for realized volatility when controlling for a \\nwide range of economic and financial predictors. Using a penalized regression framework, we identify th e most \\nrelevant variables to be investors’ attention, as measured by the number of Google searches on financial keywords \\n(e.g. ‘‘financial market’’ and ‘‘stock market’’), and the daily volume of company -specific short messages posted \\non Stock Twits. In addition, our study shows that attention and sentiment variables are able to improve volatility \\nforecasts significantly, although the magnitudes of the improvements are relatively small from an economic point \\nof view. \\nKeywords: Machine learning, Sentiments Analysis, Stock market. \\n \\nIntroduction \\nAll Stock prediction is a challenging problem in the \\nfield of finance as well as engineering and \\nmathematics. Due to its financial gain, it has attracted \\nmuch attention both from academic side and business \\nside. Stock price prediction has always been a subject \\nof interest for most investors and  financial analysts. \\nNevertheless, finding the best time to buy or sell has \\nremained a very difficult task for investors because \\nthere are other numerous factors that may influence \\nstock prices. In the prediction of stock market analysis \\na new novel approach is proposed to predict the buy or \\nsell signal to the investors. Based on the combined \\nresult of opinion of sentences \\nSentiment classification has become a very \\npopular task in Machine Learning processing area, \\nwhich tries to predict sentiment (opinion, emotion, \\netc.) from texts. \\nToday people are placing their comments and \\nopinions on social media which can be shared by \\nothers also. Sentiment classification could be done \\nin word/phrase level, sentence level and document \\nlevel. Sentiment analysis has now become the \\ndominant approach used for extracting sentiment \\nand appraisals from online sources. Subjectivity  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nanalysis focuses on dividing language units into \\ntwo categories: objective and subjective, whereas \\nsentiment analysis attempts to divide the language \\nunits into three categories; negative, positive, and \\nneutral. \\nMethodology \\nData Collection  \\n \\nThe Dataset used for news sentiment was sourced \\nfrom Kaggle. The datasets consists of Twenty Seven \\ncolumns and 4100 rows. It having \\nTwenty Five columns for top news of that day and    \\nother 2 column are date,  labels(My graph is going \\nupward or downward) and Stock data is of  Dow \\nJones Industrial. \\n \\nPreprocessing \\n \\nWe used here some techniques to remove \\npunctuation marks, to change text to  \\nlower, combining 25 columns text together (so that \\ncan perform bag of word techniques or Feature \\nExtraction ),we split dataset into Train, Test after this \\nall we applied feature extraction technique called \\nCount Vectorizer use to convert text to vectors \\n \\nAditya More \\nadityamore49891@gmail.com'),\n",
